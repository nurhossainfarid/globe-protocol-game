## Development Guidelines

### Folder Structure

The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The folder structure is as follows:

client/<br>
├── public/<br>
├── src/<br>
│ ├── components/<br>
│ ├── features/<br>
│ ├── pages/<br>
│ └── ...<br>
└── ...<br>

### Directories
- The `client` folder contains the client-side code, built using the MERN stack.
- The `server` folder contains the server-side code, implementing the API endpoints and business logic.

### Technologies Used

- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- Redux and Redux Toolkit Query for state management and data Fetching
- Mongoose as the MongoDB object modeling tool
- Material-UI for the user interface

### Code Style

We follow a consistent code style throughout the project. Some key guidelines include:

- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Follow the JavaScript/React style guide (e.g., [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)).
- Use indentation with 4 spaces.
- Write clear and concise comments when necessary.

### Testing
