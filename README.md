# Globe Protocol Game

"Save Stella_3024" is an educational game created by Team Orbvengers for NASA's Space Apps Challenge 2024. Our game "Save Stella_3024" is an educational game designed to raise environmental awareness. Players solve real-world ecological issues like pollution and climate change using GLOBE protocol data and machine learning. Set in a future Earth, players must restore balance by addressing crises in the Pedosphere (soil), Hydrosphere (water), Biosphere (living organisms), and Atmosphere (air). Real-time NASA Worldview mapping enhances gameplay with live environmental data. Learning about science can be a fun experience! Our Games that focus on science and environmental issues can create opportunities for players to develop their interests and gain knowledge while engaging with each other in a fun way.
